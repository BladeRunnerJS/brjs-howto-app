# BRJS How-to Application

An application that demonstrates "how-to" do various things within BladeRunnerJS apps.

## Internationlization

A very simple application used to demonstrate using the BladeRunnerJS Internationalization features:

* Text translation
* Locale-specific date formatting
* Locale-specific number formatting
* Parameterized translations
* Locale-specific CSS bundling

This application is used in the section on **Internationlizing your App** in the BRJS docs.

The code can be found in `blades-bladeset/blades/myblade/`. For more information on blade structure see the [blade documentation](http://bladerunnerjs.org/docs/concepts/blades/).

Read the [Internationalization docs](http://bladerunnerjs.org/docs/use/internationalization/)

## Routing

An example of how to add routing to your BRJS app using [Flatiron Director](https://github.com/flatiron/director).

This example simply demonstrates how to add basic routing to an aspect.

The code can be found in `routes-aspect/src/App.js`.
